/**
 * This package contains the classes related to the Cloud Gateway Service.
 *
 * The Cloud Gateway Service acts as the entry point for all incoming requests
 * and provides routing, filtering, and other cross-cutting concerns for the
 * microservices in the system.
 *
 * It uses Spring Cloud Gateway to handle the routing and Spring WebFlux for
 * reactive web programming.
 *
 * The main class of the Cloud Gateway Service is {@link
 * com.secretescapes.cloudgatewayservice.CloudGatewayServiceApplication},
 * which initializes and starts the service.
 *
 * Configuration classes, such as {@link
 * com.secretescapes.cloudgatewayservice.GatewayConfig}, handle the
 * configuration of the Cloud Gateway Service and define routes, filters,
 * and other settings.
 *
 * The utility class {@link com.secretescapes.cloudgatewayservice.Utility}
 * provides helper methods for the Cloud Gateway Service.
 *
 * Additional classes in this package may include custom filters, error
 * handlers, and other components specific to the Cloud Gateway Service.
 *
 * This package is part of the overall backend application of the Secret
 * Escapes system and should not be used independently.
