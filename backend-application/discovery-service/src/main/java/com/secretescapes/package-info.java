/**
 * This package contains the classes related to the Discovery Service.
 *
 * The Discovery Service is responsible for service registration, discovery, and
 * load balancing within the system. It enables service instances to register
 * themselves and provides a central registry for clients to discover available
 * services.
 *
 * The Discovery Service uses Netflix Eureka as the service registry and
 * discovery server, which allows services to dynamically register and
 * deregister themselves. It also includes a built-in load balancer to
 * distribute the incoming requests among the available instances of a service.
 *
 * Classes in this package include the main application class, configuration
 * classes, and any utility classes specific to the Discovery Service.
 * Additionally, it may include custom implementations for Eureka client
 * components or listeners to customize the behavior of the Discovery Service.
 *
 * Note that the Discovery Service plays a crucial role in the overall
 * architecture of a microservices system, as it enables service-to-service
 * communication and provides resiliency and scalability benefits.
